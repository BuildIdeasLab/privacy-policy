    <h1>Privacy Policy for Startup Validation Tool</h1>
    <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 15, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Startup Validation Tool ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>User-Provided Information</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Startup Ideas</strong>: When you use the app, you may enter descriptions of your startup ideas. This information is stored locally on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Validation Data</strong>: The app collects your responses to validation questions and criteria you provide when evaluating your ideas.</li>
        <li><strong>Progress Data</strong>: The app tracks your progress through the MVP checklist and task completion data, stored locally on your device.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Device Information</strong>: We may collect basic device information necessary for app functionality (iOS version, device model).</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: The app may collect anonymous usage statistics to improve functionality.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    
    <h3>Local Storage</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>All your ideas, validation data, and progress information are stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> using iOS UserDefaults.</li>
        <li>We do <strong>not</strong> store your personal data on our servers.</li>
        <li>You can delete all data by uninstalling the app.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
    
    <h4>1. OpenAI API</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>When you validate an idea or generate a PDF report, your idea description and validation criteria are sent to our backend server.</li>
        <li>Our backend server then sends this data to OpenAI's API to generate AI-powered feedback and reports.</li>
        <li>We do not store your ideas on our servers - they are processed and then discarded.</li>
        <li>OpenAI's use of data is governed by their privacy policy: <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank">https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. Backend Server</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Our backend server (hosted on Vercel) acts as a secure intermediary between the app and OpenAI.</li>
        <li>Your data is transmitted securely using HTTPS encryption.</li>
        <li>Data is not stored on our backend servers - it is processed and immediately discarded.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Subscription Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If you purchase a subscription, payment information is processed by Apple through the App Store.</li>
        <li>We do not collect or store your payment information.</li>
        <li>Subscription status is verified through Apple's StoreKit framework.</li>
    </ul>

        <li><strong>Apple</strong>: Subscription information is managed through Apple's App Store</li>

        <li>All data transmission uses HTTPS encryption</li>
        <li>Your data is stored locally on your device</li>
        <li>We use secure backend servers with proper authentication</li>
        <li>API keys and sensitive credentials are stored securely on our backend, not in the app</li>
    </ul>
